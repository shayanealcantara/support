There is nothing the Tor developers can do to trace Tor users.
The same protections that keep bad people from breaking Tor's anonymity also prevent us from tracking users. You can try to understand better at [our FAQ topic about tracing a user](https://support.torproject.org/abuse/help-trace-tor-user/).
