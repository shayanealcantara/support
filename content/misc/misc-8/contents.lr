description: 
If you're making non-commercial use of Tor software or if you don't modify the design or colors, you may use the Tor onion logo (as an illustration, not as a brand for your products).
You can use items that look like the Tor onion logo to illustrate a point (e.g. an exploded onion with layers, for instance), so long as they're not used as logos in ways that would confuse people. For more details, read all about that on our [Trademark faq page](https://www.torproject.org/about/trademark/).
