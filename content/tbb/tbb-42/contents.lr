description:
Tor Browser is built using [Firefox ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/), so errors regarding Firefox may occur.
Please be sure no other instance of Tor Browser is already running, and that you have extracted Tor Browser in a location that your user has the correct permissions for.
If you are running an anti-virus, please see [My antivirus/malware protection is blocking me from accessing Tor Browser](https://support.torproject.org/#tbb-10), it is common for anti-virus / anti-malware software to cause this type of issue.
